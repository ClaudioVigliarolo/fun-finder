a web-app for finding events in your area. The app gets the data from the eventful api and shows them to the user, providing event details and their position using google map API. 
If tickets are available, the user will have the chance to directly buy the tickets in an associated site.
Everything is great and I gave my best to design the site for this application (using just some default bars and some components as a template), except for the data I get from the API. I did my best to handle the garbage data (like duplicate events and inaccurate data) and display the low quality images I get in the best way possible.
Unfortunately, not all cities (like Milan) are supported and in many famous no english-speaking countries just a few events are shown. 

If your city is not supported, just try it out with New York, you will definetely get something!
Have Fun :)
